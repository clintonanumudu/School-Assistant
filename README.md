# School-Assistant

School Assistant is a mobile application that i am creating in order to help me study more efficiently and effortlessly.

I am adjusting the design and concept of the application as i am going to school and observing what is working and what isn't working.

Currently for simplicity, how the app is meant to work is that it scans notes you took in class and turns them into digital flashcards for you to study with.

The original idea was that you would scan your latest school papers, say at the end of every week and the application automatically detects in these papers what questions are likely to appear in exams as well as the full point answers to these questions and serves them as digital flashcards. So to effortlessly study for exams, all you would have to do is to flip the flashcards in your free time.
